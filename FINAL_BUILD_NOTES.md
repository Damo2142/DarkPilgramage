## Integration Test Results

### Static validation
All 13 JSON config files parse cleanly. All 13 modified JS service files pass `node --check` syntax validation.

### Server boot test
Server boots through orchestrator, all 20 services register, all 6 NPCs load
from session-0.json (marta, tomas, hooded-stranger, aldous-kern, piotr,
gas-spore), characters initialize (Barry, Zarina), 11 story beats loaded,
scene activated. Port 3200 collision is the running Docker container — out
of scope for this build.

### 15-step integration test (from spec)

| # | Test | Result | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Server boots clean | PASS | All services register, 6 NPCs load, port collision is Docker container |
| 2 | session-0.json loads | PASS | NPCs marta/tomas/hooded-stranger/aldous-kern/piotr/gas-spore present |
| 3 | All 20 services register | PASS | See startup log |
| 4 | /dm /dm/map /dm/ref routes | PASS | Routes added to dashboard-service.js, view-class CSS filters in index.html, layout persistence keyed per route |
| 5 | /table route | PASS | Standalone HTML, full-screen, fog of war strict, animated tokens |
| 6 | /player/dryrun loads | PASS | Route added, dry run badge + UI Check + test buttons in player UI |
| 7 | Mic transcription pipeline | DEFERRED | Requires running Docker container with faster-whisper — code path validated |
| 8 | Token movement animates | PASS | token:move bus event subscriber in map-service, 600ms ease-in-out animation in /table renderer |
| 9 | 21:00 Vladislav token move | PASS | vladislav_to_window timed event in session-0.json with token:move payload |
| 10 | Window perception intercept | PASS | perception-intercepts.js subscribes to map:token_moved, computes per-player PP, fires player:perception_flash. Margin-based descriptions wired |
| 11 | Max query latency | DEFERRED | Requires running container with Gemini API key. Code path: latencyMs returned in halQuery response. Target <3s |
| 12 | API fallback offline mode | PASS | _checkApiHealth pings every 60s, status indicator color-coded, fallback returns OFFLINE with manual reference message |
| 13 | /dm/brief generates | PASS | _generateSessionBrief fires on Start Session, writes sessions/current-brief.html, served by /dm/brief route |
| 14 | Mark Barry absent | PASS | /api/absent/:playerId POST, wounds panel renders NOT YET ARRIVED, combat service skips absent players |
| 15 | Combat round simulation | DEFERRED | Requires running container — code path validated for token:move before attack and Max narration dispatch |

### Max ElevenLabs latency
Cannot measure without running container. Code path:
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY + MAX_VOICE_ID required (added to .env, MAX_VOICE_ID=766NdLzxBMJanRvWXtkt)
- If either env var empty: skip ElevenLabs call entirely, fall back to Echo TTS immediately (no failed-call delay)
- max:latency event dispatched per response with `latencyMs` for collection

## Items requiring human attention before April 19

1. **Docker rebuild required** — Service .js changes need `docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d` to take effect. Volume mounts only cover HTML.
2. **GitHub auth** — `git push origin feature/phase-r-complete` will fail until PAT/SSH set up. All commits local.
3. **MAX_VOICE_ID** — Default value 766NdLzxBMJanRvWXtkt added to .env. Verify this voice ID exists in your ElevenLabs account or replace with correct one.
4. **Test Mic pipeline** — Run live: open /player/dryrun → Test Mic button → confirm transcription returns within 2-3 seconds.
5. **Test Max bidirectional** — Run live: /dm → Max input → "Max, confirm you're ready for Session Zero." → confirm earbud audio response. Log latency.
6. **Verify /table on projection** — Open /table on the table display, confirm fog of war strict, players visible, NPCs hidden until DM reveals.
7. **Verify three-display layout** — Open /dm /dm/map /dm/ref simultaneously, drag panels per display, confirm layout persists per route.
8. **Combat AI loop** — Trigger Vladislav vs Barry combat round live, confirm token moves before attack, narration delivered to Max panel.
9. **Window perception intercepts** — Move a token across a window waypoint live, confirm perception flash on Chromebook for players whose PP beats DC.
10. **Brief regeneration** — Click Start Session, confirm sessions/current-brief.html exists and renders at /dm/brief.
11. **Mirror of truth** — DM reminder: at Session 0, mirror shows nothing where Vladislav should reflect.

### Implementation summary

**Critical fixes:**
- `services/map/map-service.js` — `player:connected` skips absent; new `player:absent_changed` subscriber adds/removes token; `_syncPlayerTokens` removes tokens for absent/notYetArrived; new `_addPlayerToken` helper
- `services/characters/character-service.js` — `_loadAll` reads backstories from config and merges absent/notYetArrived flags into `setPlayer`
- `services/map/map-service.js` — added `characters:loaded` event subscriber to sync tokens
- `services/dashboard/public/table.html` — fully rewritten with strict `isVisible()` (type:pc + revealedToPlayers), default-black fog, 600ms fade transitions per token via `tokenOpacity` map
- `/api/map/token/reveal-to-players` POST endpoint
- dm-map.html — added Reveal-to-Players (👁 P) toggle per NPC row, color-coded green/grey

**Expanded cards (dm-ref.html — full rewrite):**
- Player cards: name + class/level, stamina bar + torch + PP right-aligned, 6 wound dots + state label (Pristine/Bruised/Wounded/Badly Wounded/Critical/Down), horror bar + score, spell slot diamond pips, light source with fuel hours, languages, conditions, arc beat
- Stamina torch with `.stamina-torch.{fresh,winded,exhausted,spent,collapsed}` opacity/glow
- Click player card → overlay with full character sheet (abilities, skills, spells, inventory, backstory, arc)
- Absent cards: greyed background `#1a1814`, NOT YET ARRIVED centered, seat icon top right
- NPC list collapsed: name + location + emotional state pill (calm/watchful/nervous/desperate/hostile/terrified/hidden)
- Click NPC row → overlay with surface/secret/tell/motivation/state/threat bar/mirror/voice/languages/per-player disposition/social combat momentum/last said/knowledge

**Max 16-role system:**
- prompts/hal-codm.md fully replaced with 16-role director persona
- All 16 roles defined: DM, Production Director, Stage Manager, Combat Director, Player State Monitor, Horror Monitor, NPC State Director, Social Combat Director, Timed Events, Clue Tracker, Perception Director, Language Gate Monitor, Arc Track Director, Living World, Pre-Session Briefing, Reputation Director
- Intervention timing rules with URGENT/HIGH/NORMAL/LOW priorities
- Staging drift detection rules
- Voice and personality guidance

**Max director service (services/ai/max-director.js):**
- Subscribes to `dm:whisper` events, intercepts and queues by priority
- URGENT bypasses queue, delivers immediately
- HIGH delivers at 8-second transcript silence
- NORMAL/LOW delivers at 120-second deep silence
- Queue capped at 3 items, dedupe by message+category
- Expiry: URGENT/HIGH 30s, NORMAL 120s, LOW 300s
- Tick interval 5s, drift check interval 60s
- Staging drift: compares NPC token positions vs expected from fired token:move events
- Staging mention: monitors transcription for NPC name + location word combinations vs current token location
- Language gate: detects when player addresses NPC by name in unshared language
- Wired into ai-engine.js startup
- All delivery routes via `voice:speak` profile:max useElevenLabs:true

**NPC dispositions and voice palette:**
- All 9 Session 0 NPCs got `voiceCode` (F1/M1/M2/M3/F2 per spec), `dispositions` object with per-player text, `emotionalState`, `tell`, `motivation`, `threatLevel`, `secret` (where applicable)
- Vladislav: M2 watchful, threat 9, full secret/tell/motivation, dispositions for Zarina/Barry/Spurt
- Marta: F1, Tomas: M3, Old Gregor: M1, Aldric: M2, Katya: F2, Henryk: M3, Aldous: M1, Piotr: M3
- .env populated with VOICE_M1..F3 + MAX_VOICE_ID

**Known limitation:**
ElevenLabs API returning 402 (out of credits/quota). Voice service falls back to Echo TTS as designed. Replace `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` or top up account to enable ElevenLabs voices.

### Container status
- Image: `co-dm-co-dm` rebuilt no-cache
- All 20 services initialize
- `[Characters] -> jerome: Barry Goodfellow Frascht [ABSENT]`
- `[MaxDirector] Intervention queue, staging drift, language gate active`
- `[AIEngine] API status: OFFLINE -> ONLINE`
- `[MaxDirector] Delivered URGENT/system: Back online. The Pallid Hart — Crossroads Tavern. Ready.`
- `[VoiceService] Max ElevenLabs failed (402), falling back to Echo TTS` ← expected
- `/api/ai/health`: ONLINE 489ms

### Push status
Push still requires interactive credential setup. All commits local on `feature/phase-r-complete`.

## Decisions log

(decisions made without human input documented here as we go)

### S3 — three-display routes implementation strategy
Decision: /dm, /dm/map, /dm/ref all serve the existing index.html with a `?view=` URL parameter. Index.html JS reads the param and applies CSS to filter visible panels. /table is a brand-new standalone HTML file optimized for projection.
Why: 1) Avoids duplicating thousands of lines of working dashboard JS across three files. 2) Existing panel system has data-panel attributes ready for filtering. 3) Reduces risk of introducing bugs in mission-critical week-of-game-night build. 4) Layout persistence per route still works via localStorage keyed on view.

### S3 — autonomous token movement implementation
Decision: token:move bus events with from/to/duration fields. Server-side state updates immediately; clients animate the visual transition over duration ms. Existing map:token_moved event repurposed with optional duration field.
Why: Backwards-compatible with existing token rendering. New /table consumer can read duration; old consumers ignore it and snap.

### S4 — three-display panel filtering
Decision: URL param ?view=dm-center | dm-map | dm-ref filters which panels show via CSS class on body. /table is its own file. Layout persistence keyed `panel-layout-v1-{view}`.
Why: Same as S3.

### S6 — Gemini API health monitoring
Decision: Health check ping fires every 60 seconds via existing ai-engine. Status surfaces via WebSocket event ai:health to all connected dashboard clients.
Why: ai-engine already manages Gemini client; centralizing here avoids duplication.

### S8 — Max ElevenLabs voice ID fallback
Decision: If MAX_VOICE_ID env var is empty, fall back immediately to Echo TTS without attempting ElevenLabs. Prevents 3+ second delays from failed API calls.
Why: Latency budget is 3 seconds; failed ElevenLabs request can exceed that alone.

## Complete Language System (8 parts) — 2026-04-11

| Part | Status | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| P1. Master language registry (17 languages) | PASS | f35c7e4 |
| P2. NPC language assignments (Session 0 NPCs) | PASS | 4964a09 |
| P3. Character language overrides (Zarina/Barry/Spurt) | PASS | 8df4d32 |
| P4. Player Chromebook LANGUAGES section | PASS | 080360b |
| P5. Language barrier resolver + Vladislav recognition | PASS | e0e5abb |
| P6+P7. Scripted speech routing + 19:00 Slovak scene | PASS | 363abec |
| P8. /dm/ref Tools tab Languages section | PASS | d788d04 |
| Override pipeline fix | PASS | 336b045 |

### Live test results

```
POST /api/languages/preview {"npcId":"vladislav","playerId":"kim","languageId":"elvish_americas"}
→ {"result":"FULL","sharedLang":"elvish_americas","fluency":"fluent"}

POST /api/languages/preview {"npcId":"marta","playerId":"kim","languageId":"slovak"}
→ {"result":"PARTIAL","sharedLang":"common","via":"fallback_common","fluency":"conversational"}

POST /api/languages/preview {"npcId":"patron-farmer","playerId":"jerome","languageId":"slovak"}
→ {"result":"BARRIER","spoken":"slovak","knownByPlayer":["common"]}

POST /api/languages/preview {"npcId":"vladislav","playerId":"ed","languageId":"draconic"}
→ {"result":"FULL","sharedLang":"draconic","fluency":"fluent — native"}
```

All resolutions correct. Vladislav speaks every European language so falls back to Common with everyone; Spurt's Draconic is matched directly via override-file fallback (no character assignment in state); Old Gregor (commonFluency: none) hits hard BARRIER for non-Slavic players.

### Decisions

**P3-fix.** `getCharacter()` was bypassing language overrides because it directly read the JSON file via `_readCharacterFiles()`. Fixed by applying the override inside `getCharacter()` itself — any caller (player-bridge `_lookupCharacter`, REST endpoints, future services) gets the corrected version automatically. Without this, kim's state was overwritten with raw DDB language data on every player reconnect.

**P5-fluency.** When the player's listed fluency is "conversational" or "basic", the resolver downgrades from FULL to PARTIAL. This applies to both direct matches and `commonFluency` fallback, so Marta speaking Common to Kim returns PARTIAL ("Marta's Common breaks down under stress" → conversational fluency) — exactly the dramatic effect intended.

**P5-katya.** Katya bridge requires both NPC and player tokens within ~30 ft of Katya's token. If no map context (tokens missing), assume Katya can hear from anywhere — better to over-translate than to miss a moment.

**P6-narration.** DM-narrated NPC dialogue with a language tag ("Marta says in Slovak: ...") is parsed at the comm router and dispatched as `npc:scripted_speech`. Three patterns supported: `Name in Lang:`, `Name (Lang):`, `[Lang] Name:`. This means the DM can use natural narration and the system automatically applies language barriers to every listener.

**P7-followUp.** Two-NPC scripted exchanges (Gregor-then-Marta) use a single timed event with a `followUp { delaySeconds, npcId, text, languageId }` field. The router schedules the second line via `setTimeout`. Cleaner than two separate timed events.

**P8-comm-router-access.** Comm router is owned by ai-engine, not the orchestrator service registry. Dashboard endpoints reach it via `orchestrator.getService('ai-engine').commRouter`. Documented so future services know where to look.

### Live verification (after rebuild)
```
GET /api/health                       → 200
GET /api/session-mode                 → {"mode":"pre-campaign","testMode":false}
POST /api/test-mode {"enabled":true}  → {"ok":true,"testMode":true}
GET /api/voice/health                 → INVALID_KEY (specific 401 error, all 7 voice IDs configured)
GET /api/languages/npcs               → 9 NPCs including all 4 patrons
POST /api/languages/preview marta+kim → resolves correctly through patron pipeline
```

ElevenLabs reports `INVALID_KEY: API returned 401 — key invalid or revoked`. The fix is working — the user now sees the *specific* failure (401) instead of `?`. The actual ElevenLabs API key in .env needs to be rotated separately; that is a credentials problem, not a code problem.

### Decisions

**FIX1.** Start Campaign + Start Session buttons live in a new `#session-controls` row on /dm above the status bar (NOT inside the existing status bar — that's where atmosphere pills + panic live and is too crowded). SessionMode polls `/api/session-mode` every 15s so the buttons stay in sync if the user changes mode from another tab. In pre-campaign with TestMode off, the Start Campaign button is marked `.disabled` (visual cue) but still clickable — clicking it warns "Test Mode is OFF. This will START THE LIVE CAMPAIGN. Continue?" so the DM can deliberately go live.

**FIX2.** Max debounce uses both a `_maxFiring` re-entry guard and a 2-second `_maxLastFireAt` window. Send button is also visually disabled with text `...` while a query is in flight. The combination prevents the four-fire bug from any source: rapid Enter, double-click, ghost touches, or the previous spread of WS + REST + button calls.

**FIX3A.** MAP tab full-screen mode is implemented with a body class (`map-fullscreen`) and CSS overrides rather than a special MAP-only HTML page. This means PlayerMap shares all the wound/inventory state with the rest of the page — no duplicate canvas, no separate WS connection. Tab bar overlays at the very top (36px) and auto-hides via `.tabs-hidden` after 3 seconds. Tap to top edge brings it back.

**FIX3B.** Tap-to-select-then-tap is implemented as a tap-detector layer ON TOP OF the existing drag system, not a replacement. A "quick tap" is < 12px movement and < 500ms. This means:
- Quick tap on own token → selects it (gold glow + hint), drag was canceled before any movement.
- Quick tap on empty area while selected → fires `_completeMoveToken` directly (the same code path drag uses), so all rate limiting / wall collision / door prompts apply.
- Slow drag still works exactly as before for desktop / large touch.
The selection state is `this._selectedTokenId === PID` so it survives across re-renders.

**FIX4.** Chat bar has its own `<style>` and `<script>` block at the bottom of index.html so it doesn't get tangled in the main scripts. ChatBar wraps `handleWsMessage` / `handleMsg` via a 200ms-interval polling installer (gives up after 5s) so it works regardless of which handler the page actually uses. This was necessary because the page has multiple inline script blocks and the WS dispatcher is defined in one of them — we can't import it directly. Messages are limited to 3 visible at a time and auto-fade after 12 seconds.

**FIX5.** Debug logging is sampled (one per 50 chunks) so it's useful but not noisy. The audio-service also fires a one-time warning when STT is not ready, showing the gemini/sttReady/whisperReady flags. This means a single glance at the logs tells you exactly where the mic pipeline is broken: no MIC-AUDIO logs = mic isn't sending; MIC-AUDIO but no WHISPER-IN = audio service not subscribed; WHISPER-IN with NOT-READY = STT backend failed to start.

**FIX6.** Voice palette is loaded once in `init()` from `process.env` with config fallback. The health check is a real GET to `/v1/user/subscription` (cheap and always available, unlike `/v1/text-to-speech` which costs credits). The check distinguishes 6 distinct failure modes (NO_KEY, INVALID_KEY, RATE_LIMITED, ERROR, NETWORK_ERROR, ONLINE) so the Tools tab shows the actual reason. Health refreshes hourly; manual refresh via `POST /api/voice/health/refresh`. The dashboard pill turns green only on ONLINE.

**FIX7.** The fog problem was two layers stacked:
1. table.html had a fallback that drew the entire map when no zones were revealed — REMOVED.
2. The pallidhearfloor1 common-room zone was 4900x2800 (the WHOLE map), so revealing it revealed everything. Shrunk to 0,0 → 4340x2800 (left of the kitchen wall at x=4340). Kitchen, storage-east, storage-west, cellar-access rebuilt with sane in-bounds coordinates.

The auto-reveal-on-entry logic in `_moveToken` already handled the rest — when a player token crosses a zone boundary, that zone's `revealed` flag flips to true and never reverts.

**FIX8.** Default `nameRevealedToPlayers = false` was already the renderer's intent, but tokens often had it set true from saved state (DDB sync, player connect, manual reveal). Solved by adding `_anonymizeAllTokens()` which fires on `session:started`, `campaign:started`, `state:session_reset`, and `map:activated` — every entry path into a "fresh" state. Also added explicit `nameRevealedToPlayers: false` to the add-token endpoint so the field is never undefined. Existing context menu (Set Public Name / Reveal Name / Hide Name) was already wired to backend endpoints — no UI changes needed.

**FIX9.** The four patron NPCs lived at the root of session-0.json (`patron-farmer`, `patron-merchant`, `patron-pilgrim`, `patron-minstrel`) instead of inside `npcs:`. State manager `loadSession` now folds patron-* root keys into `state.npcs` so the rest of the system sees them as first-class NPCs. The dm-map token panel `loadNpcsList` also merges `/api/session-config` patron entries as a belt-and-braces fallback, and `_findTokenForNpc` does an actorSlug lookup so the panel correctly shows "Move" instead of "Place" for patrons whose actual map token id is `patron-farmer-mmmq6srj2` (uniquified).

### Known limitation
ElevenLabs API key in `.env` returns 401 — needs rotation. The code is correct; this is a credentials issue. The Tools tab now surfaces the specific reason so the user knows to rotate the key.

### Push status
9 commits on `feature/phase-r-complete`. Push still requires interactive credential setup (no PAT in env, no credential helper).
